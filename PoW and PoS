The proof of stake (PoS) protocol is one of the most significant elements of contemporary blockchain architecture. Not only does it provide efficiency, but it is also cost effective and future-proof. As blockchain technology rapidly expands into fields other than cryptocurrency, the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol is being left behind, mainly because of its inefficiency and archaic nature. While PoW may be useful for cryptocurrencies, PoS is favoured when it comes to unrelated areas such as logistics, big data, artificial intelligence, and other mathematical fields.
